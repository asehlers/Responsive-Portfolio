				<p>My name is Andrew Ehlers. I graduated from NJIT in 2016 with a B.S. in Computer Science. I spend the last year and half working retail sales at Micro Center. Currently I'm taking Rutgers Coding Bootcamp to develop new skills and advance myself professionally.</p>
	
				<br>

				<p>My interests are varied. I like learning about new technology and how things work. I've played games of all kinds; tabletop RPG, video games, board games, and a few sports. My family also loves the outdoors so much of the time spent with my family is outside. One of my professional interests is machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p>
